# This is a fork of [Linux-PredatorSense by snowyoneill](https://github.com/snowyoneill/Linux-PredatorSense)

## Q&A
### Why did I create this fork?
Quite simply, I'd like to add my own ideas without changing the original project.
##
### What are the future changes in this fork?
1. Add support for [GameMode by FeralInteractive](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode?tab=BSD-3-Clause-1-ov-file#readme)
2. Find an alternative or a tweak to ```msr-tools``` and ```undervolt``` for Secure Boot support.
3. Pre-compiled built file
4. _Possibly more compability with other Acer Predator laptops._
5. Some additions, corrections and removals in this fork.

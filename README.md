## Predator Senseâ„¢ clone for ```PH315-51-78NP``` to control fan speed on Linux. This application is intended for "Acer Predator Helios 300", 2018 model.

## Disclaimer:
* This program uses ```ec_sys``` kernel module to function. Check using ```find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*.ko*' | grep ec_sys```. If it isn't listed, you'll have to rebuild the kernel yourself manually. Arch Linux and Ubuntu do ship the kernel with this module available.
* Secure Boot is **not** supported.
* Using this application with other laptops may potentially damage them. Proceed at your discretion. Though it most likely works with other **Acer Predator Helios 300** models.
* It does **not** work with OpenBSD's root access command port, ```opendoas```. Use ```sudo``` instead when running through a terminal.

## Minimal usage (not recommended):
Dependencies are ```evtest``` and ***Python Qt5***.
All you need to do is run the main script as root:
```
# python main.py
```
***Warning: This will create ```__pycache__``` owned by "root". Use ```sudo rm -rf``` to delete if desired.***

## Full installation:
Dependencies:
* Ubuntu / Linux Mint:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip evtest python3-qtpy git
```
* Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S python-pip evtest python-pyqt5 git
```

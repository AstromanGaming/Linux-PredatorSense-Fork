# PredatorNonSense
Clone of Acer's Predator Senseâ„¢ application for fan control on Linux

# * Important *
- Only the fan controls work.
- Other tabs are buggy and may crash the system.
- Fan control works fine on my 2021 Predator Helios 300, PH315-53-72W3.
- This code is tested on Kubuntu 20.04 LTS, you might encounter some issues used on others, if so consult StackOverflow.
- It is not garunteed to work on your model.
- DO NOT RUN THIS ON A DEVICE OTHER THAN A HELIOS 300. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
- YOU ARE WARNED NOT TO USE THIS IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
- I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BRICKING YOUR DEVICE.
- Helios 300 users: It is recommended to verify that the EC location and data values are the same for your model, link given below

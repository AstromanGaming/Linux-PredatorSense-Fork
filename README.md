* Using this application with other laptops may potentially damage them. Proceed at your discretion. Though it most likely works with other **Acer Predator Helios 300** models.

* Application may fail to launch the first time. Opening it again will fix it.

## This is a fork of [PredatorNonSense by kphanipavan](https://github.com/kphanipavan/PredatorNonSense), customized for ```PH315-51```.

## Changes:
* Added custom font (TT Squares);
* Removed dysfunctional tabs (keyboard lighting settings, fan profiles, GPU overclock);
* Added dark theme;
* Added custom icon;
* Made the window not resizeable;
* General UI improvements;
* Refactored the code for easier maintenance;
* Dynamically disabled buttons to prevent unexpected behavior;
* Global fan state is now remembered across sessions;

The app is in a satisfactory state and only thing left to do is changing the install script to be compatible with other distros.

## Predator Senseâ„¢ clone for ```PH315-51-78NP``` to control fan speed on Linux. This application is intended for "Acer Predator Helios 300", 2018 model.

## Disclaimer:
* Secure Boot is **not** supported.
* Using this application with other laptops may potentially damage them. Proceed at your discretion. Though it most likely works with other **Acer Predator Helios 300** models.
* It does **not** work with OpenBSD's root access command port, ```opendoas```. Use ```sudo``` instead when running through a terminal.
* Application may fail to launch the first time. Opening it again will fix it.
* Dropped support for Fedora as it ships the kernel without the necessary ```ec_sys``` module enabled. You can, of course, recompile the kernel yourself. But at that point it is probably better to switch to another distro, like Arch. ;)
## Usage: (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Arch Linux)
```
git clone https://github.com/mohsunb/PredatorSense.git
```
```
cd PredatorSense
```
```
sudo ./install.sh
```
```
predator-sense
```
... or use the desktop entry.
